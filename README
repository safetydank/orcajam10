TROUBLESHOOTING AUDIO INPUT

The game tries to recognize your system's default audio input device. If you
have more than one device connected this may fail.  To manually set your audio
input device edit the file "audio.ini" and change the first line to the
appropriate device id.

The complete list of id's found on your system is listed in "audio.ini".  This
is recreated every time the app is run.
